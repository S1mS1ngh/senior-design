# Diagram Descriptions

## Level 0
Diagram 0 gives a general description of the flow of the app when user interacts with it. Circle signals the beginning 
and end points of the app and squares represents certain features or interactions that is available to end-user when 
theyâ€™re using the app. Beside authentication boxes, the app main feature is represented through other component boxes. 
Since this is a social network in a sense, the end-user will be able to use private messaging, group messaging and chat 
channels for communication. All necessary information about their classrooms will be aggregated onto the main page for 
them.
## Level 1
Diagram 1 introduces some complexity with the appearance of notable features like the homepage features.
The diagram is in the perspective of any user and is not broken down into multiple roles like in Level 2. The arrows 
in the diagrams represent the flow of the user throughout the system. Each box is a specific portion of the project and 
will be expanded upon in the next level.
## Level 2
Diagram 2 further introduces complexity into the system. The diagram now provides a user flow for multiple users with 
different privileges. Since the platform contains students as well as professors or admins, the platform will require a 
control hierarchy. The level expands on boxes from the previous level which were specific pages or features and creates 
additional boxes for those items. This diagram also introduces the connections for the database and brings in more of a 
technical sense into the diagram.
