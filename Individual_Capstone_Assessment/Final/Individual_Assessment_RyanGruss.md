## Final Individual Capstone Assessment

Part A

For our senior design project, I have contributed a good amount to the project for as little knowledge of this type of material I have. I have never worked with Web Apps, databases, wireframe designs, or APIs before this project so everything was new to me. My co-op experiences were as a Windows Admin who worked with virtual machines and Active Directory 
so I was out of my comfort zone on this project. For fall semester I would participate in the team meetings and do my best to soak in and understand the material the more experienced members were talking about. I did my share of the fall assignments and contributed what I could, but Sim was our main front end brain and Giang was our backend one.
I spent most of fall trying to learn React as well to catch up to their skill levels and at least contribute whatever I could to the build of the project. Besides from the normal assignments like the slides presentations, my final contribution was creating the forum interaction for our page.

I have definitely learned a lot through this project and gained skills I did not have before. I never used react before this or did any database work either, but I feel I have gained a decent understand of both and how they work. Going into the project with none of those skills, I would say I improved a lot. I have never used Javascript before this project either and I learned a good amount of that as well.
My soft skills were improved as well, as I had not had many online meetings like this before and it was a good experience to improve my communication skills. It also helped my problem solving skills as I have never created a forum before and I had to figure that out with no previous knowledge.
I feel bad that I could not contribute as much to the project as some of the other members did as I feel like I was doing a lot of research to have a basic understanding of what we were attempting, but I learned alot from this experience and gained new skills that I never had a chance to gain before.
