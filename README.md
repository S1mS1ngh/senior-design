#### Abstract
Bearcat Circle is a Web application that aims to simulate the in-person learning experience and aid with remote 
learning. The application combines existing communication software all into one easy-to-use package. Students can post 
discussions, chat with other students and much more. Bearcat Circle makes it easy for students to explore and branch 
out of their existing circle.

#### Description
The Cincy Study platform uses web frameworks to create a website that allows for improved communication in a remote 
environment. The platform uses a login page along with separate pages for specific features like groupchats, classes, 
etc. The platform will feature a homepage which will have all the core components of the platform on one 
main page. Each classroom/feature will have its own respective page for the best user experience. With all of these 
pages and features we hope to create a positive learning community for students from anywhere in the world.
