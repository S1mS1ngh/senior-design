#### Topic Area
Online Student Learning Community

#### Abstract
Our project aims to improve student engagement and interactions virtually and aid with remote learning. Since the start
 of the pandemic, classes have been significantly less interactive, which can make it more difficult for students to 
 learn and succeed. It can also be hard for students to find others to work with. To tackle this problem, weâ€™re 
 creating an easily accessible online platform that combines the functionality of multiple student tools for learning 
 and communication. Our app will help students meet others, study for their classes and collaborate with other 
 students while also providing incentive for students.

#### Description
The Cincy Study platform uses web frameworks to create a website that allows for improved communication in a remote 
environment. The platform uses a login page along with separate pages for specific features like groupchats, class 
assignments, etc. The platform will feature a homepage which will have all the core components of the platform on one 
main page. Each classroom/feature will have its own respective page for the best user experience. With all of these 
pages and features we hope to create a positive learning community for students from anywhere in the world.
