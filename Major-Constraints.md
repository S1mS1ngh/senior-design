# Major Constraints
Identifying and elaborating on several topical areas that may constrain the possible solutions for the project
#### Outreach
 - Reaching out to enough students to be aware of app
 - Reaching out to enough sponsors to be able to create incentives
#### Interest
 - Create enough incentives for students to be interested in app
#### Time
 - Project requirements will be affected by the limited timeline. Stretch goals are in place if expectation is too generous.
#### Safety & Security
 - Since the platform is online users have the freedom of sharing what they choose and content will need to be monitored.
#### Scope
 - Scope creep could cause project to keep expanding and specific goals need to be set
#### Design
 - Team consists of computer science and computer engineering students with minimal design experience (UX/UI)
