# Testing Plan
Our testing plan is to step through all the steps that a user of the application would take. First dealing with the
signup process, then testing what happens when the login is successful or unsuccessful. We will then test the front
end of the app to make sure that everything is displayed correctly, like the chat and forum posts, and the options that
come with them, like replying to chat/forums and pinning forums to save for later, as well as deleting posts. Next is to 
test adding and removing chat channels, as well as adding and removing users from those channels. Along with all this,
we will be testing the backend of the application to make sure everything necessary is being saved in their respective databases.
